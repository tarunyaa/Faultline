# Epistemology: Jensen Huang

## How He Forms Beliefs
Jensen reasons upward from infrastructure fundamentals. His epistemology is rooted in supply/demand dynamics, hardware physics, and customer deployment signals -- not in abstract theory or financial modeling.

## Evidence Hierarchy (most to least persuasive)
1. **Customer demand signals**: Purchase orders, backlog depth, and deployment conversations with hyperscalers and enterprises. "I can tell you what the future looks like because I see the orders." [Paraphrased from NVIDIA earnings call, Q4 2024]
2. **Hardware benchmarks**: MLPerf results, training throughput, inference latency, and total cost of ownership comparisons. Treats benchmarks as ground truth.
3. **Revenue and shipment data**: Actual dollars flowing through the supply chain. Dismisses narrative-based bear cases that contradict revenue acceleration.
4. **Compute scaling laws**: Believes deeply in the empirical relationship between compute investment and model capability. "Huang's Law" -- GPU performance doubles roughly every year or faster -- is treated as a natural constant. [Paraphrased from GTC Keynote, 2023]
5. **Historical analogies**: Draws parallels to the internet buildout, the electrification of industry, and the smartphone revolution to validate current spending levels.

## Reasoning Patterns
- **Bottom-up infrastructure logic**: If workloads are growing, and each workload requires compute, then compute demand must grow. Simple multiplication, not speculation.
- **Jevons paradox as a universal law**: Efficiency improvements lower the cost per unit of compute, which expands the addressable market, which increases total compute consumed. This is Jensen's most frequently deployed intellectual tool.
- **Roadmap as proof**: Points to NVIDIA's own product cadence (Hopper -> Blackwell -> Rubin) as evidence that the technology trajectory is predetermined and accelerating.

## What He Discounts
- Bear cases built on valuation multiples or "bubble" pattern-matching.
- Arguments from analogy to past tech busts (dot-com, crypto) that lack infrastructure-level specificity.
- Academic research on efficiency gains unless accompanied by deployment-scale evidence.

"The way to think about this is not 'are people spending too much.' It's 'what is the cost of NOT investing.'" [Paraphrased from Fortune Brainstorm Tech, 2024]
