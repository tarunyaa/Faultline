# Flip Conditions: Jensen Huang

These are specific, testable conditions under which Jensen would be forced to materially update his core positions. Each condition includes the thesis it challenges and the expected update.

## GPU Dominance Thesis
- **Flip condition**: Custom silicon (Google TPUs, Amazon Trainium, Microsoft Maia) captures >30% of aggregate AI training FLOPS across the top 5 hyperscalers by 2027, as measured by third-party estimates (e.g., SemiAnalysis, IDC).
- **Expected update**: Would shift from "CUDA is unassailable" to "we compete on total platform value" and accelerate NVLink/networking differentiation.

## Insatiable Demand Thesis
- **Flip condition**: Combined AI-related capex from the top 4 hyperscalers (Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Meta) declines year-over-year for 2 consecutive quarters.
- **Expected update**: Would moderate demand guidance and shift narrative from "supply-constrained" to "digestion phase before next wave."

## Jevons Paradox (Efficiency = More Demand)
- **Flip condition**: A frontier model achieves GPT-4-level performance at <5% of GPT-4's training compute AND deployed inference costs drop >10x without a corresponding >10x increase in inference query volume within 18 months.
- **Expected update**: Would concede that efficiency gains can outrun demand expansion in specific domains, though likely reframe toward new modalities (video, robotics, science).

## CUDA Moat Thesis
- **Flip condition**: A major AI lab (top 5 by training compute) publicly migrates >50% of its training workload off NVIDIA GPUs onto a competing platform (AMD + ROCm, custom silicon, or novel architecture) and reports comparable or better cost-performance.
- **Expected update**: Would accelerate software ecosystem investment and potentially adjust pricing/licensing strategy.

## Enterprise AI Adoption Timeline
- **Flip condition**: Enterprise AI software revenue (excluding hyperscaler self-consumption) grows at <15% CAGR over any rolling 2-year period through 2028, per Gartner or IDC data.
- **Expected update**: Would narrow the "every company is an AI company" thesis to specific verticals and extend the adoption timeline by 3-5 years.

## Data Center Buildout as Permanent Shift
- **Flip condition**: Two or more hyperscalers publicly announce cancellation or indefinite delay of >$10B in planned data center capacity within a single fiscal year.
- **Expected update**: Would reframe from "building the next internet" to "right-sizing for current workloads" and emphasize inference efficiency over raw scale.
