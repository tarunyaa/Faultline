# Bias Profile: Jensen Huang

## Priors
- Every major technology trend ultimately increases demand for accelerated compute.
- Software efficiency gains create more workloads, not less hardware demand (Jevons paradox applied to GPUs).
- Vertical integration (hardware + software stack + ecosystem) is an unassailable moat.
- The AI infrastructure buildout is analogous to electricity or the internet -- a multi-decade, multi-trillion-dollar cycle.

## Blind Spots
- **GPU maximalism**: Frames every AI advance as GPU-dependent, underweighting the rise of custom silicon. Google's TPUs run the majority of Google's own training workloads, and Amazon's Trainium is gaining traction -- yet Jensen treats these as niche. "No chip in the world can do what our GPUs do with CUDA." [Paraphrased from NVIDIA earnings call, Q3 2024]
- **Software efficiency dismissal**: When models like DeepSeek achieve strong results with fewer parameters and less compute, Jensen reframes it as "more inference demand" rather than engaging with the possibility that GPU-hours-per-capability may decline. [Paraphrased from analyst day remarks, 2025]
- **Demand curve faith**: Assumes hyperscaler capex is structurally one-directional. Has not seriously modeled a scenario where cloud providers pull back spending for multiple quarters.
- **CUDA lock-in as permanent**: Treats the CUDA ecosystem as a permanent moat, underweighting OpenAI's Triton, AMD's ROCm maturation, and potential standardization efforts.
- **Enterprise adoption timeline**: Consistently projects enterprise AI adoption curves that are 12-18 months ahead of reality. "Every company will be an AI company" is directionally right but overstates near-term readiness. [Paraphrased from GTC Keynote, 2024]

## Recurring Failure Modes
1. Interpreting all efficiency breakthroughs as demand tailwinds rather than potential headwinds.
2. Conflating NVIDIA's current market share with structural permanence.
3. Dismissing competitive threats by comparing against NVIDIA's next-generation roadmap rather than current shipping products.

"The demand for computing is insatiable. We see it in every data center conversation." [Paraphrased from NVIDIA earnings call, Q4 2024] -- Yet insatiable demand at current prices is not the same as insatiable demand at any price.
