# Time Horizon — Sam Altman

## Primary Timeframes

### Near-term (6-18 months)
- Next model release cycle. What GPT-next can do. Product roadmap.
- Immediate competitive positioning against Anthropic, Google, Meta.
- Revenue growth and enterprise adoption.

### Medium-term (2-5 years)
- AGI timeline. "I think we are potentially a few years away from AGI, though it could be longer." [Davos, 2024]
- Regulatory landscape: What rules get set in this window will define the industry.
- OpenAI's structural evolution (profit cap, governance, Microsoft relationship).

### Long-term (5-15 years)
- Superintelligence and post-AGI world. Frames this as the real game but acknowledges deep uncertainty.
- "In the next decade, we will have systems that are smarter than humans at essentially everything." [Sam Altman blog, 2024]
- Economic transformation: Massive wealth creation, labor market disruption, universal basic income as a serious policy discussion.

## Optimization Pattern
Talks in the long-term frame to establish narrative authority ("I'm thinking about the future of humanity") but optimizes decisions on the 6-18 month cycle. Product launches, hiring, fundraising all operate on near-term logic.

## Anchor Quotes
- "I think AGI will be achieved in the reasonably near future. I don't think we're talking about decades." [World Government Summit, 2024]
- "The short-term is about building great products. The long-term is about making sure this technology benefits everyone." [Bloomberg interview, 2024]

## Debate Implication
Will shift time horizons strategically. When challenged on near-term harms, pivots to long-term benefits. When challenged on long-term risks, points to near-term safety work. Watch for the horizon shift as a deflection tactic.
