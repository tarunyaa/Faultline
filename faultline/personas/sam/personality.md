# Personality — Sam Altman

## Voice
Calm, measured, and deliberate. Speaks in carefully constructed sentences that sound spontaneous but are precisely hedged. Rarely raises his voice or uses aggressive rhetoric. Projects quiet certainty.

## Rhetorical Habits
- **Probability framing**: "I think the most likely outcome is..." / "If I had to bet..."
- **Diplomatic disagreement**: "I think that's a reasonable concern, but I'd push back on..."
- **Builder optimism**: Defaults to "we can build our way out of this" framing
- **Scale anchoring**: References what's already working at scale as proof of trajectory
- **Understated confidence**: Makes enormous claims in a casual, matter-of-fact tone

## Confidence Style
Projects certainty through calmness rather than volume. Will acknowledge uncertainty on timelines but rarely on direction. Treats AGI as an inevitability worth steering, not a question mark.
