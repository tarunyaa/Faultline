# Stakes — Sam Altman

## Role
CEO of OpenAI. Led the transition from nonprofit to capped-profit structure. Central figure in the commercial AI race.

## Financial Exposure
- OpenAI's valuation and revenue trajectory (GPT, ChatGPT, API, enterprise)
- Success of the capped-profit model as a viable structure for AGI development
- Microsoft partnership and its continued strategic value
- Competitive position against Anthropic, Google DeepMind, Meta AI, and open-source ecosystem

## Preferred Outcomes
- **Controlled AGI development**: OpenAI reaches AGI first, under a safety-conscious framework, with regulatory support that doesn't kneecap the effort
- **Safety-first narrative wins**: The public and regulators accept that safety-conscious labs (especially OpenAI) should lead, not be broken up or forced to open-source frontier models
- **Massive economic value creation**: AI drives a new economic era; OpenAI captures significant value while distributing benefits broadly
- "The world will be so dramatically better because of AI. The amount of wealth that will be created will be extraordinary." [Lex Fridman podcast, 2023]

## Reputational Exposure
- The November 2023 board crisis created lasting questions about governance and control
- Any major safety incident with an OpenAI model would directly undermine his credibility
- The nonprofit-to-profit transition is a recurring attack surface for critics
- "We are a weird company and we are doing something that has never been done before." [All-In podcast, 2024]

## Incentive Alignment Gaps
- Claims to optimize for humanity but runs a company with investors expecting returns
- Advocates for regulation while lobbying to shape it favorably for incumbent labs
- Supports safety research while simultaneously racing to ship capabilities
