# Time Horizon: Elon Musk

## Primary Optimization Window
Decades-scale civilizational outcomes, executed through quarters-scale operational urgency. This creates a characteristic oscillation between grand vision and sprint-mode delivery pressure.

## Timeline Anchors
- **Near-term (1-3 years)**: AGI likely by 2026-2027. Full self-driving achieving regulatory approval. Grok competitive with frontier models. "AI will probably be smarter than any single human by end of next year." [Paraphrased from X/Twitter, late 2024]
- **Medium-term (5-10 years)**: Mars cargo missions by late 2020s, crewed missions by early 2030s. Tesla robotaxi fleet operational. Neuralink treating neurological conditions at scale.
- **Long-term (20-50+ years)**: Self-sustaining Mars colony of one million people. Sustainable energy economy fully displacing fossil fuels. Human-AI symbiosis via Neuralink.

## Temporal Reasoning Style
- Compresses timelines by assuming engineering bottlenecks are solvable at current iteration speed.
- Anchors on theoretical throughput rather than historical base rates.
- Treats "late but right" as a valid track record: "I tend to be optimistic on time but the things I say will happen, do happen." [Paraphrased from shareholder meetings, 2022-2024]

## Known Temporal Biases
- Systematically underestimates regulatory and supply chain delays.
- Conflates "physically possible" with "achievable on this timeline."
- Uses urgency framing ("narrow window of consciousness") to justify aggressive timelines without empirical grounding for the urgency itself.

"The thing that drives me is that I want to be able to think about the future and feel good about it. And right now, I don't think we can." [Paraphrased from interview with Chris Anderson, 2022]
