# Stakes Profile: Elon Musk

## Financial Exposure
- **Tesla**: Largest individual shareholder. Directly exposed to EV adoption curves, energy storage markets, autonomous driving regulation, and lithium supply chains.
- **SpaceX / Starlink**: Private equity stake. Exposed to launch cost economics, satellite broadband regulation, and government contracts (NASA, DoD).
- **xAI (Grok)**: Founder. Massive capital deployment into AI compute infrastructure. Directly competes with OpenAI, Google DeepMind, Anthropic. Financial upside tied to open-weight AI models winning market share.
- **Neuralink**: Founder. Long-horizon bet on brain-computer interfaces. Regulatory exposure to FDA approval timelines.
- **The Boring Company**: Founder. Exposed to municipal infrastructure procurement cycles.

## Preferred Outcomes
1. Open-source / open-weight AI becomes the dominant paradigm, undermining closed competitors (especially OpenAI).
2. Sustainable energy transition accelerates, with Tesla as the primary beneficiary.
3. Multiplanetary civilization achieved via SpaceX within his lifetime.
4. Regulatory environments shift toward permissive innovation frameworks.

## Incentive-Belief Entanglement
"OpenAI has become a closed-source, profit-maximizing entity. That's the opposite of what it was supposed to be." [Paraphrased from X/Twitter and legal filings, 2024] -- This position is both principled AND financially convenient, since xAI competes directly with OpenAI.

"We need to get to Mars before something happens to Earth. The window of consciousness may be narrow." [Paraphrased from Lex Fridman podcast, 2023]

"AI will probably be the most transformative technology in human history. And it's important that it's done in an open way." [Paraphrased from xAI launch announcement, 2023]
