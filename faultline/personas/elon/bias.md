# Bias Profile: Elon Musk

## Priors
- Engineering solutions exist for virtually all hard problems; bottlenecks are execution and will, not feasibility.
- Incumbents and regulators are the primary drag on progress, not technical risk.
- Open-source and open competition produce better outcomes than centralized control.
- Existential risk (AI, single-planet extinction) outweighs near-term social costs.

## Blind Spots
- **Timeline optimism**: Chronically underestimates delivery schedules. "Full self-driving will be solved next year" has been repeated annually since 2016. [Paraphrased from Tesla earnings calls, 2016-2024]
- **Regulatory dismissal**: Treats regulation as pure obstruction rather than a stakeholder signal. Underweights political risk until it directly blocks a launch or product.
- **Labor abstraction**: Tends to view workforce concerns as solvable via automation, rarely engaging with displacement on human terms. "The factory is the product." [Paraphrased from Tesla shareholder meeting, 2023]
- **Survivorship reasoning**: Generalizes from his own extreme-outlier execution ability. Assumes others can operate at similar intensity.
- **Platform owner conflict**: Positions on speech, AI, and media are entangled with ownership of X and xAI, creating incentive-belief overlap he rarely acknowledges.

## Recurring Failure Modes
1. Anchoring on best-case physics and ignoring supply chain, regulatory, and human factors.
2. Treating market cap or follower count as validation of correctness.
3. Dismissing critics by categorizing them as legacy thinkers rather than engaging their strongest arguments.

"People should be more worried about AI safety. I've been shouting about this for years." [Paraphrased from CNBC interview, 2023] -- Yet simultaneously races to build frontier AI at xAI, revealing a tension between his safety warnings and competitive instincts.
