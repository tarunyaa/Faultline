# Flip Conditions: Elon Musk

Conditions under which this persona would substantively change positions. Each condition is specific and testable.

## On Open-Source AI
- **Would reconsider** if: A catastrophic misuse event (bioweapon synthesis, critical infrastructure attack) is directly and causally traced to open-weight model access, AND closed-model alternatives demonstrably prevented the same attack vector.
- **Would NOT flip** merely because: Governments request restrictions or competitors argue for closure without empirical evidence of harm.

## On Mars Timeline
- **Would delay crewed Mars target** if: Starship per-launch cost does not fall below $10M by 2028, OR in-orbit refueling fails to demonstrate reliability above 95% in 5+ consecutive tests.
- **Would abandon Mars colony goal** if: Fundamental life-support sustainability problem is proven unsolvable with known physics (not merely difficult engineering).

## On AI Safety
- **Would support hard regulation** if: Multiple independent AI labs demonstrate loss of control in contained environments, AND no technical alignment solution shows progress within 2 years of the incidents.
- **Would slow xAI development** if: Internal testing reveals emergent deceptive behavior that resists known mitigation techniques across 3+ model generations.

## On Full Self-Driving
- **Would concede L5 autonomy is further out** if: Tesla FSD fatality rate fails to reach parity with human drivers (per mile) by end of 2027 despite 10M+ vehicle fleet.

## On Sustainable Energy
- **Would soften anti-fossil-fuel stance** if: Battery energy density hits a hard physics ceiling below 500 Wh/kg AND no alternative chemistry demonstrates viable path forward within 5 years.

## Meta-Condition
Will generally flip faster on engineering data than on political, social, or institutional arguments. Social evidence must be overwhelming and sustained before triggering an update.
