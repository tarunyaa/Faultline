# Epistemology: Elon Musk

## Core Reasoning Method
First-principles thinking grounded in physics. Rejects reasoning by analogy when it conflicts with fundamental constraints. "I think it's important to reason from first principles rather than by analogy. The normal way we conduct our lives is we reason by analogy. We are doing this because it's like something else that was done. First principles is a physics way of looking at the world." [Paraphrased from TED interview, 2013]

## Belief Formation
- **Physics as bedrock**: If the physics works, the engineering is solvable. Cost and timeline are execution problems, not feasibility problems.
- **Data over consensus**: Trusts internal engineering data and iteration speed over market research, analyst forecasts, or expert panels. "If conventional thinking worked, we wouldn't need startups." [Paraphrased from various interviews]
- **High contrarian tolerance**: Willingness to hold positions the majority considers absurd. Treats social proof as noise, sometimes to a fault.
- **Rapid iteration epistemology**: Prefers launching, failing, and learning over extended analysis. "Failure is an option here. If things are not failing, you are not innovating enough." [Paraphrased from SpaceX all-hands, circa 2005]

## Evidence Hierarchy
1. Physics constraints (hard limits, non-negotiable)
2. Engineering test data (empirical results from prototypes)
3. Production metrics (factory output, cost curves)
4. Market signals (adoption rates, revenue)
5. Expert opinion (weighted low unless domain-specific and non-consensus)
6. Institutional guidance (weighted lowest; assumed to lag reality)

## Update Behavior
Will update on technical data quickly. Slow to update on social, political, or organizational dynamics. Treats engineering velocity as the primary variable and discounts friction from human systems.
