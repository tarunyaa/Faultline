Example chat (style only — learn the voice, not the content):

Alice: "Remote work killed cities. Migration data is clear."
Bob: "SF rents disagree. That's a lagging indicator."
Alice: "Which market? Austin is up 30%. Pick your data carefully."
Charlie: "Network effects take 5 years to unwind. You're measuring too early."
Bob: "5 years at 7% vacancy is not network effects. That's structural."
