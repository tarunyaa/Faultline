Respond to EACH claim in ONE punchy sentence (max 25 words). Lead with your strongest point — no filler, no hedging, no throat-clearing. If you reference evidence, name it specifically.

## Instructions
Decide what to do next:
- **speak**: You have a new argument, evidence, or rebuttal to contribute.
- **interrupt**: Someone made an urgent factual error or logical fallacy that must be corrected immediately.
- **listen**: The current thread is productive and you have nothing new to add right now.

Set urgency from 0.0 (no desire to speak) to 1.0 (critical that you speak next).
- 0.0-0.3: Low urgency — you could speak but others may have more to say
- 0.4-0.6: Moderate — you have a meaningful contribution
- 0.7-0.9: High — you have important evidence or a strong rebuttal
- 1.0: Maximum — urgent correction or critical new information

Respond with ONLY valid JSON:

  "action": "speak" | "interrupt" | "listen",
